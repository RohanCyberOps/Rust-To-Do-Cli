# 🌐 Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 🌈 Our Pledge

As contributors and leaders, we commit to creating a harassment-free, inclusive environment for everyone—no matter their age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience, socioeconomic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We strive to foster a welcoming and vibrant community where everyone can thrive, share ideas, and contribute meaningfully.

## 🤝 Our Standards

**Positive Behaviors:**  
- Show empathy, kindness, and respect to all.
- Value diverse perspectives and respect differing opinions.
- Offer and receive constructive feedback gracefully.
- Take responsibility for mistakes, apologize, and learn from them.
- Focus on what benefits the community as a whole.

**Unacceptable Behaviors:**  
- Sexualized language or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Sharing others’ private information without consent.
- Any behavior deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 👥 Responsibilities of Community Leaders

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing these standards fairly. This includes moderating interactions, clarifying acceptable behavior, and taking appropriate action when necessary. Leaders may edit, remove, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## 🌍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and includes instances where individuals represent the community in public forums, such as official events or social media channels.

## 🚨 Reporting & Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to our enforcement team at [your.email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and addressed with confidentiality and respect.

### Enforcement Process

Our leaders will follow these guidelines to ensure fair consequences for violations:

1. **Correction:** For minor incidents, a private warning will be issued with an explanation. A public apology may be requested.
   
2. **Warning:** For repeated or serious incidents, a formal warning with conditions may be issued, including a specified period of limited interactions.

3. **Temporary Ban:** For sustained or serious violations, a temporary ban from community interactions may be enforced.

4. **Permanent Ban:** For repeated serious offenses or harassment, a permanent ban will be enforced.
